# Train-Scheduler
This project demonstrated the use of Jquery, CSS, and HTML, AJAX, and firebase. Using these aspects, I was able to build a train scheduler that appended new trains to the section above to display the train name, destination, frequency of trains, the next train arriva; and ultimately how many minutes away the next train is.

Getting Started: Access the train scheduler here at https://samuelpai.github.io/Train-Scheduler/. Once directed to the URL, you can add in the data in the entry forms. Once you type in the data, the app will append the exact train name, destination, and frequency typed into the table above. Then using moment.js as well as javascript properties, the app calculates the time of arrival for the next train and how many minutes away it is from the current time. It will then append it to the table above in the appropriate sections.

Prerequisites None

Built With CSS HTML Javascript Jquery  Moment.js Firebase Bootstrap
